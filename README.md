# Cheese Bread

### Work in progress

A small poem about cheese bread:

	"cheese bread
	is for all tastes
	delicious as a kiss,
	big, tiny, simple, composed
	and the smell, oh! too exaggerated
	January, February, August
	any day, month, time - they are the ones!
	in the morning and in the afternoon for breakfast, ready
	it's really good man! Wow, it's from Minas Gerais..."
	- Luciano Spagnol

Commands you can use:

- **cheese sync** | updates the local repo

- **cheese install** | installs a package

- **cheese remove** | removes a package

- **cheese run** | runs a package

- **cheese stop** | stops a package (might be removed in the future)

- **cheese help** | Prints the commands above (just using **cheese** does the same)

Sorry about the script taking a few seconds to load, `http.GetAsync` is crashing my game so I can't use it, and for some reason it is returning incomplete data

This will **NOT** have a graphical interface (GUI)
